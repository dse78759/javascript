## Experiments to do

* save()  - saves context state to stack; smallest example?
* restore() - pops from stack 
* compositing: filled circle over / obscured/ masked by square

1 source-over : icon walks in front of something
2 source-in : use for icon within a 'window'
3 source-atop : icon within a background window

* 5 coordinate plot, no fill, in shape of star
* number of milliseconds to draw 1000 random circles
* animation - filled rectangle crossing canvas
* what happens if you draw off corner of canvas
* 

# Done:
* lighter : transparency = set context.fillstyle = "rgba ( #, # ,# , decimal #)";  
so three integhers for red green blue, but then a number from 0 - 1 to represent transparentcy
* circle experiments with arc, partial arcs,
